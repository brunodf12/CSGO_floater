# CSGO_floater
Python script sorts all weapons' floats in the Steam market.

*Script created in 2020/2021.*

In 2023, Steam released an update that made it difficult to extract skin data via APIs, rendering this script ineffective nowadays.

**V1.0.0** -
Extracts all data from the page, filters, and processes until reaching the final sorted float.

**V1.0.1** -
It doesn't use the default link but has a better code with a more organized output in .json format.
